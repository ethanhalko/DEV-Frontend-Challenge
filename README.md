# Local Line Frontend Dev Challenge

## Notes:

- There were no image paths provided so I created a placeholder
- I renamed the files to *.jsx in order to be able to add tests
- Areas where data was missing or unclear I either used a N/A placeholder or added a check to omit the element
- The endpoint provided only updates `order_note` so I used that instead of additional `customer_note` entries

## Running Locally

1. In terminal navigate to the root of the challenge folder and install with the command `yarn`
2. To start the solution run the command `yarn start`
3. To run tests use `yarn test`
